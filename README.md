### Git Workflows
Check the current status of changed or modified files in your repo:

```
git status
```

Add changed files to the staging area:
```
git add .
```

Commit the staged changes to your local repo:

```
git commit -m "Description of the commit here"
```

Push your local repo online:

```
git push
git push -u origin master
```

### Notes

Installing gulp into the project folder as a developer dependency (devDependency) via npm:

```
npm install --save-dev gulp
npm install --save-dev gulp-util
```

When we do this, npm is going to automatically fill out our **package.json** file.
