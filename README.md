## Git Workflows
Check the current status of changed or modified files in your repo:

git status

Add changed files to the staging area:

git add .

Commit the staged changes to your local repo:

git commit -m "Description of the commit here"

Push your local repo online:

git push

git push -u origin master

### Notes

Installing gulp into the project folder as a developer dependency (devDependency) via npm:

npm install --save-dev gulp

npm install --save-dev gulp-util

When we do this, npm is going to automatically fill out our package.json file.
